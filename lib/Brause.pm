=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick summary of what the module does.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use brause;

    my $foo = brause->new();
    ...

=head1 EXPORT

A list of functions that can be exported.  You can delete this section
if you don't export anything, such as for a purely object-oriented module.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 talk

This is the only public function and it only expects the data to be sent
and the config values. It returns the data structures we got back from
the EPP server. There is no parsing done in the moment so all the
responses are ust plain XML snippets.

=cut

sub talk {
    my ( $data, $conf ) = @_;

    my $res = _send( $data, $conf );
    return $res;
}

=head2 _template

This internal function parses the data structure into our XML template
and returns the full XML request.
It expects a 'template_path' config value with the path to the relevant
template tree.

=cut

sub _template {
    my ( $data, $conf ) = @_;
    $data->{command} = $data->{command} . '.tt';
    my $t = Template::Alloy->new( INCLUDE_PATH => [ $conf->{template_path} ], );
    my $template = '';
    $t->process( 'frame.tt', $data, \$template ) || die $t->error;
    return $template;
}

=head2 _send

This internal function connects to the EPP server, reads the greeting
and logs in and then send the XML template we want to send. The response
has the greeting, the response from the login and the response from the
command we ran.

=cut

sub _send {
    my ( $data, $conf ) = @_;

    my $client;
    my $t= new XML::Twig;

    $IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG = 3 if $conf->{debug};

    if ( $conf->{ssl_cert} ) {
        $client = new IO::Socket::SSL(
            PeerAddr      => $conf->{host},
            PeerPort      => $conf->{port},
            #LocalAddr     => $conf->{myip},
            Blocking      => 1,

            SSL_use_cert  => 1,
            SSL_key_file  => $conf->{ssl_key},
            SSL_cert_file => $conf->{ssl_cert},
        );
        sleep 1;
    }
    else {
        $client = new IO::Socket::SSL(

            PeerPort  => $conf->{port},
            #LocalAddr => $conf->{myip},
            Blocking  => 1,
        );
    }
    die "Could not open socket: " . IO::Socket::SSL::errstr() . "\n"
      unless defined $client;

    my $greet;

    my $length = 0;

    my $read;
    # read lentgh (in Bytes)
    read( $client, $read, 4 );
    $length = unpack( "N", $read );
    $length -= 4;    # the length bit itself

    # read until $length bytes read
    while ( $length > 0 ) {
        $length -= read( $client, $read, $length );
        $greet .= $read;
    }

    if($conf->{debug}){
        print "greeting from the server:\n";
        $t->parse($greet);
        $t->set_pretty_print( 'indented');
        $t->print;
        print "----------\n";
    }

    my @response;
    foreach my $req ( @{$data->{step}} ) {
        my $request = _template( $req, $conf );
        if($conf->{debug}){
            print "sending this template:\n";
            $t->parse($request);
            $t->set_pretty_print( 'indented');
            $t->print;
            print "----------\n";
        }

        my $req = sprintf( "%s%s", _lE2bE( length($request) + 4 ), $request );
        print $client $req;

        my $stream;
        my $read;
        my $length = 0;

        # read lentgh (in Bytes)
        read( $client, $read, 4 );
        $length = unpack( "N", $read );
        $length -= 4;    # the length bit itself
        print "reading $length bytes ...\n" if $conf->{debug};

        # read until $length bytes read
        while ( $length > 0 ) {
            $length -= read( $client, $read, $length );
            $stream .= $read;
        }
        if($conf->{debug}){
            print "received this response:\n";
            $t->parse($stream);
            $t->set_pretty_print( 'indented');
            $t->print;
            #print $stream;
            print "----------\n";
        }
        push( @response, $stream );
    }
    return { greet => $greet, response => \@response };
}

=head2 _lE2bE

This internal function converts little endian to big endian as network
byte order as defined in the EPP RFCs is normally not what we have on a
machine running this code base.

=cut

sub _lE2bE {
    my $number = shift;
    my ( $c, @numbers ) = (0);
    for ( my $c = 0 ; $c < 4 ; ++$c ) {
        push @numbers, $number % 256;
        $number >>= 8;
    }
    return
      sprintf( "%c%c%c%c", $numbers[3], $numbers[2], $numbers[1], $numbers[0] );
}
